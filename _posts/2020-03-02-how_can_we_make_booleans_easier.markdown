From what ive obseved, or  should i say retained is something of a game show mentality for booleans. Basically you are given all the tools and either your statement will come out true or false. The whole 50/50 either or helps me categorize whatever value is imputed to get true outputs. That being said the symbols used to represent the and, ors, ect. can be shown with as the numerous charts and examples available in numerous resources. 

** Value	Truthy?**
0 -	yes
""	- yes
[]	- yes
"hello"	- yes
nil	- no
6.7	- yes
true	- yes
TRUE	- yes
false	- no
FALSE	- no
[1,2]	- yes
{:hi=>"there"}	- yes

1.  ! ("single-bang") which represents "NOT",
2.  && ("double-ampersand") which represents "AND", and
3. || ("double-pipe") which represents "OR".

These references just on hand from the learn.co site are such examples of resources in which the information can be found however, having information and regergiatating content doesn't hold any value in the end. Comprehenson and memorization can be more valuable for actaul applications. That being said under my understanding, i connected it with a Mathematic Background in how equations can be true or false graphed on cartisian planes and line segments. For me the connection helped me see by perspective only the true or false statments as well as the yes or no "truthies". 

The next step i took was to recognize the patterns iin which the charts displayed in the code portryed in th booleans section in the learn curriculum. Hopefully the information helps someone else and gifts a little perspective.
