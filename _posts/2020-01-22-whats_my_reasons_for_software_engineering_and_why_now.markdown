The first step to any type of growth is crucial,  or thats how I believed it to be. Sometimes the the confusion of what am I going to do today or for the rest of your life seems to really weigh more on your mind than it should. Its this same thought that lead me here, to Flatirons software engineering program. I've did a number of jobs before from construction to warehouse work, security and retail, I've even had my go at college. It seemed like nothing was working. Either the time or money never to seem to be on my side. Which lead me to reseach the question what do I want to do. I have messed around with many job types like stated above even worked with family with trades like mechanics, elctricians, plumbers, and weilders. So to try something different then what my family has been (blue color), I decided to try out engineering as a field of work. Collectively I hope to accomplish something greater then just completing a course at a school, rather to change my start the foundation to build my dream upon. I hope for nothing but good thins with this experience.
